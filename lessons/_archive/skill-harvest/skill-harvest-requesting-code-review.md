# Pre-Commit Code Verification

Automated verification pipeline before code lands. Static scans, baseline-aware
quality gates, an independent reviewer subagent, and an auto-fix loop.

**Core principle:** No agent should verify its own work. Fresh context finds what you miss.

## When to Use

- After implementing a feature or bug fix, before `git commit` or `git push`
- When user says "commit", "push", "ship", "done", "verify", or "review before merge"
- After completing a task with 2+ file edits in a git repo
- After each task in subagent-driven-development (the two-stage review)

**Skip for:** documentation-only changes, pure config tweaks, or when user says "skip verification".

**This skill vs github-code-review:** This skill verifies YOUR changes before committing.
`github-code-review` reviews OTHER people's PRs on GitHub with inline comments.

## Step 1 — Get the diff

```bash
git diff --cached
```

If empty, try `git diff` then `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD`.

If `git diff --cached` is empty but `git diff` shows changes, tell the user to
`git add <files>` first. If still empty, run `git status` — nothing to verify.

If the diff exceeds 15,000 characters, split by file:
```bash
git diff --name-only
git diff HEAD -- specific_file.py
```

## Step 2 — Static security scan

Scan added lines only. Any match is a security concern fed into Step 5.

```bash
# Hardcoded secrets
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -iE "(api_key|secret|password|token|passwd)\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{6,}['\"]"

# Shell injection
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "os\.system\(|subprocess.*shell=True"

# Dangerous eval/exec
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "\beval\(|\bexec\("

# Unsafe deserialization
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "pickle\.loads?\("

# SQL injection (string formatting in queries)
git diff --cached | grep "^+" | grep -E "execute\(f\"|\.format\(.*SELECT|\.format\(.*INSERT"
```

## Step 3 — Baseline tests and linting

Detect the project language and run the appropriate tools. Capture the failure
count BEFORE your changes as **baseline_failures** (stash changes, run, pop).
Only NEW failures introduced by your changes block the commit.

**Test frameworks** (auto-detect by project files):
```bash
# Python (pytest)
python -m pytest --tb=no -q 2>&1 | tail -5

# Node (npm test)
npm test -- --passWithNoTests 2>&1 | tail -5

# Rust
cargo test 2>&1 | tail -5

# Go
go test ./... 2>&1 | tail -5
```

**Linting and type checking** (run only if installed):
```bash
# Python
which ruff && ruff check . 2>&1 | tail -10
which mypy && mypy . --ignore-missing-imports 2>&1 | tail -10

# Node
which npx && npx eslint . 2>&1 | tail -10
which npx && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | tail -10

# Rust
cargo clippy -- -D warnings 2>&1 | tail -10

# Go
which go && go vet ./... 2>&1 | tail -10
```

**Baseline comparison:** If baseline was clean and your changes introduce failures,
that's a regression. If baseline already had failures, only count NEW ones.

## Step 4 — Self-review checklis
