# Manim Video Production Pipeline

## When to use

Use when users request: animated explanations, math animations, concept visualizations, algorithm walkthroughs, technical explainers, 3Blue1Brown style videos, or any programmatic animation with geometric/mathematical content. Creates 3Blue1Brown-style explainer videos, algorithm visualizations, equation derivations, architecture diagrams, and data stories using Manim Community Edition.

## Creative Standard

This is educational cinema. Every frame teaches. Every animation reveals structure.

**Before writing a single line of code**, articulate the narrative arc. What misconception does this correct? What is the "aha moment"? What visual story takes the viewer from confusion to understanding? The user's prompt is a starting point — interpret it with pedagogical ambition.

**Geometry before algebra.** Show the shape first, the equation second. Visual memory encodes faster than symbolic memory. When the viewer sees the geometric pattern before the formula, the equation feels earned.

**First-render excellence is non-negotiable.** The output must be visually clear and aesthetically cohesive without revision rounds. If something looks cluttered, poorly timed, or like "AI-generated slides," it is wrong.

**Opacity layering directs attention.** Never show everything at full brightness. Primary elements at 1.0, contextual elements at 0.4, structural elements (axes, grids) at 0.15. The brain processes visual salience in layers.

**Breathing room.** Every animation needs `self.wait()` after it. The viewer needs time to absorb what just appeared. Never rush from one animation to the next. A 2-second pause after a key reveal is never wasted.

**Cohesive visual language.** All scenes share a color palette, consistent typography sizing, matching animation speeds. A technically correct video where every scene uses random different colors is an aesthetic failure.

## Prerequisites

Run `scripts/setup.sh` to verify all dependencies. Requires: Python 3.10+, Manim Community Edition v0.20+ (`pip install manim`), LaTeX (`texlive-full` on Linux, `mactex` on macOS), and ffmpeg. Reference docs tested against Manim CE v0.20.1.
